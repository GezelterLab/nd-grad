## License

Because much of the code in this directory is taken directly from the books mentioned above, I have placed the appropriate LICENSE file in each of the book directories. Similarly, the headers for all examples contain a copyright notice so it is clear where the code came from. Where there have been exercises for the reader to complete, I have covered those under the MIT License which can be found [here](https://github.com/crdrisko/nd-research/blob/master/LICENSE).
