# Homework 4 - Cody R. Drisko

## Question 1)

a) From **Table 1.1** we can see that the bond lengths of the equilibrium structures match our chemical intuition for what these should be. The shortest bonds in both structures belongs to the molecules actually bonded to H<sub>1</sub>, while the longest distance occur between the H<sub>1</sub> atom and whatever it isn't bonded to. For the C - C and C - O bonds, it is easy to see that the bond length shortens when the atoms are double bonded to each other.

b) 

c) 

d) The results of the single point energy calculations are shown in **Table 1.2**. 

e)

**Table 1.1:** Internal Coordinates of some of the bonds in the Acetaldehyde and Vinyl Alcohol structures. Lenghts in parentheses denote non-bonded distances.

| | **Acetaldehyde** | **Transition State** | **Vinyl Alcohol** |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **H1 - C (&#8491;)** | 1.093   | (1.524) | (2.485) |
| **C - C (&#8491;)**  | 1.509   | 1.412   | 1.335   |
| **C - O (&#8491;)**  | 1.211   | 1.285   | 1.363   |
| **O - H1 (&#8491;)** | (2.581) | (1.291) | 0.972   |

**Table 1.2:** Single-Point Energy calculations of Acetaldehyde and Vinyl Alcohol using the MP2/6-31G(d) level theory. ZPE's were scaled by 0.9613 as they were calculated using B3LYP.

| | **Product - Reactant (kJ/mol)** | **TS - Reactant (kJ/mol)** |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| **Base Calc**    | 70.9577 | 383.5188 |
| **MP2/6-31G(d)** | 69.9423 | 318.0305 |
| **ZPE**          |  2.1630 | -13.6643 |
| **MP2 + ZPE**    | 72.1053 | 304.3662 |
