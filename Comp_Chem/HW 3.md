# Homework 3 - Cody R. Drisko

## Question 1)

a) There are 16 primitive Gaussians and 12 total basis functions included in this calculation. These are split up among the s, p, and d orbitals accordingly:

* s: 6 Primitive Gaussians in one basis set shell.
* p: 10 Primitive Gaussians in three basis set shells.
* d: 0 Primitive Gaussians.

b) The number of SCF iterations required to converge was 12 for this calculation.

c) The final energy of the Ar atom was -524.4520526614 Hartrees.

d) The energies for each of the orbitals are shown in **Table 1.1** below. The identities of the occupied orbitals in Argon from lowest energy to highest are: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p.

e) From **Table  1.1**, we can see that the total HFS energy and all orbital energies are lower in the FDA calculation than in the GAMESS calculation. Ultimately though, Iâ€™d say the agreement between the two methods is actually pretty good.

**Code 1.1:** GAMESS input file for argon atom undergoing a single-point energy calculation with HFS.

| **E_3p**        | -0.3222 Hartrees   | -0.5735 Hartrees   |

## Question 2)

a) The spin multiplicity of SO<sub>2</sub> is singlet, because there are no unpaired electrons.

* Multiplicity = 2 * (S=0) + 1 = 1

b) The calculation used 48 primitive Gaussians and 49 total basis functions.

c) It took 22 cycles before the energy calculation converged.

d) Even though we didn't specify it, it looks like by default the SCF algorithm used by GAMESS is Restrictive Hartree-Fock (RHF): `SCFTYP=RHF`.

e) The final total energy of the SO<sub>2</sub> molecule is -548.2422757249 Hartrees.

f) The energy of the HOMO is -0.2837 Hartrees and the energy of the LUMO is -0.1546 Hartrees. The molecule has a total of 16 occupied orbitals.

g) The final dipole moment of the molecule is 1.508668 Debyes. Compared to the [experimental value](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.437860) of 1.63305 Debyes, this calculation was off. Potentially the coordinates I picked for this molecule are causing it to under-calculate the dipole moment.

h) The gross charges on each atom of the SO<sub>2</sub> molecule are shown in **Table 2.1**. Based on the fact that the charges on oxygens are not equal and that the Mulliken estimation is based on the geometry of the molecule, it is safe to say that the molecule is not properly symmetric.

i) We can see the electrostatic potential of the SO<sub>2</sub> molecule in **Figure 2.1**. The blue (positive) end on the sulfur atom corresponds to the *electrophilic*  end, while the red (negative) ends on each of the oxygen atoms corresponds to the *nucleophilic* end.

## Question 3

a) Shown in **Codes 3.1**, **3.2**, and **3.3** are the template for the GAMESS input, bash script to run the calculation, and python script to plot the energies as a function of bond length and angle, respectively. The results from the calculations are shown in **Figure 3.1**. The lowest energy (-548.249 Hartrees) occurs at a S-O bond distance of 1.50 &#8491; and a O-S-O angle of 120.0&#176;.

b) According to the optimization run (**Code 3.4**), the optimal bond distances for the S-O bond is 1.491 &#8491;, and the optimal angle for the O-S-O angle is 118.5&#176;. Considering the bond angles and lengths were varied by 5 units each time in part a, we actually got pretty close. This optimization was much faster but ultimately, the two methods agree.

**Code 3.1:** Template for each of the runs that will attempt to optimize the energy of the SO<sub>2</sub> molecule by minimizing the energy. Here, 'LEN' will be replaced by values between 1.30 and 1.70 &#8491;, and 'ANG' will be replaced by values between 90.0 and 150.0&#176;.
